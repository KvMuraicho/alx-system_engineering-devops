1. Confused smiley-displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'.
2. Let's display a file-displays  the content of the /etc/passwd file.
3. What about 2-displays the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts.
4. Last lines of a file-display the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd
5. I'd prefer the first ones actually-display the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd
6. Line #2-displays the third line of the file iacta.
7. It is a good file that cuts iron without making a noise-creates a file named exactly \*\\'"Best School"\'\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:) containing the text Best School ending by a new line.
8. Save current state of directory- writes into the file ls_cwd_content the result of the command ls -la. If the file ls_cwd_content already exists, it should be overwritten. If the file ls_cwd_content does not exist, create it.
9. Duplicate last line-duplicates the last line of the file iacta.
10. No more javascript-deletes all the regular files (not the directories) with a .js extension that are present in the current directory and all its subfolders.
